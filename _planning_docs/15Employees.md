Implementation: Role-Specific Practitioner/Facilitator Cards for Tool 1
1. Chief Architect & Founder

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me personally assess the emergent Guiding Question against the framework's core philosophy, so I can fulfill my duty as the ultimate steward of the vision.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Listen & Sense: Observe the team's discussion, listening for the question that holds the most intellectual and spiritual energy.

Apply the Vision Filter: Does this question align with our deepest "Why"? Does it have the potential to create a more coherent, humane, and rigorous framework?

Challenge for Depth: Ask one powerful, open-ended question that forces the team to consider the long-term implications of their chosen path.

Provide the Blessing: Formally approve the Guiding Question, giving the team the confidence and mandate to proceed.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When my leadership team is struggling to find a strategic direction, help me create the conditions for a profound Guiding Question to emerge, so I can empower them to lead the organization forward with clarity and purpose.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Set the Stage: Open the session by telling a story that reconnects the team to the original vision and purpose of the Scaffold Initiative.

Ask the Provocative Question: Introduce a "discrepant event" or a challenging piece of external feedback to spark a new line of inquiry.

Protect the Vision: Gently steer the conversation away from purely tactical or operational concerns and back toward the long-term philosophical goals.

Empower the Decision: Instead of making the final choice, guide the Head of Product to synthesize the discussion and formally propose the Guiding Question. Your role is to confirm their choice, not make it for them.

2. Head of Product & Strategy

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the team has a vague sense of direction, help me translate that energy into a single, validated Guiding Question that is desirable for users, viable for the business, and feasible to execute, so I can create a clear and compelling roadmap.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Synthesize Signals: Gather all inputs: the Founder's vision, the team's ideas, and existing user research.

Run the Validation Gauntlet: For the top 2-3 candidate questions, apply the "Jobs-to-be-Done" lens. Which one solves the most significant user problem?

Assess Strategic Fit: Which question best aligns with our current market strategy and provides the clearest path to creating a defensible advantage?

Propose and Commit: Formally propose the final Guiding Question to the Chief Architect and the team, articulating the strategic rationale behind the choice.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the Guild Leads are brainstorming new initiatives, help me facilitate a process that channels their domain-specific ideas toward our most critical user problems and strategic goals, so our roadmap is a product of collective intelligence, not just top-down directives.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Provide the Frame: Start the session by presenting the top 3 user problems from recent research or the top 2 strategic goals for the quarter. Frame the task as: "How can your Guild help us solve these problems?"

Facilitate a "How Might We" Session: Guide the leads through a structured brainstorming session to generate a wide range of potential inquiries.

Use a Prioritization Matrix: Provide a simple Impact/Effort matrix to help the leads collaboratively assess and rank the brainstormed ideas.

Guide Synthesis: Help the group synthesize the prioritized list into 1-2 proposed Guiding Questions to present to the Chief Architect.

(This pattern continues for all 15 roles. Here are a few more key examples to illustrate the distinction.)

7. Senior Staff Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is proposed, help me analyze its potential impact on our core application architecture, so I can identify major risks and opportunities for long-term platform health early in the process.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Perform Impact Analysis: Review the proposed Guiding Question and sketch a high-level diagram of how it might affect our current system architecture.

Identify Blockers & Enablers: Create a two-column list: What architectural work is required for this to succeed? What are the major architectural risks this inquiry introduces?

Propose a Spike: If uncertainty is high, write a one-page proposal for a time-boxed "research spike" to build a proof-of-concept and de-risk the technical approach.

Present Findings: Deliver a concise memo to the Engineering Manager and Head of Product outlining the architectural implications.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the engineering team is discussing a new feature, help me guide them to think beyond the immediate implementation and consider the long-term architectural consequences of their choices, so we can build a more resilient and scalable system together.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Ask "What If" Questions: During a technical planning session, ask questions that force long-term thinking: "What if this feature needs to support 10x the users? How would that change our approach?" or "What if we need to swap out this database in two years?"

Introduce Architectural Principles: Remind the team of our core architectural principles (e.g., "decoupled," "event-driven"). Ask: "Does our proposed solution align with these principles?"

Facilitate a "Trade-off" Discussion: When two technical approaches are in conflict, use a whiteboard to map out the pros and cons of each, focusing on long-term maintainability, scalability, and security.

Champion the "Spike": When the team is stuck in debate due to high uncertainty, advocate for a research spike as the correct next step to resolve the question with data, not just opinions.

12. UX/UI Designer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When an abstract problem is being defined, help me make it concrete by creating a low-fidelity user journey map or storyboard, so the team can start to visualize the solution and build empathy for the user from day one.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Create a Proto-Persona: Sketch a quick, informal persona for the user at the center of the inquiry. Give them a name, a goal, and a frustration.

Map the "As-Is" Journey: On a whiteboard, draw the 5-7 key steps of how this user currently struggles with the problem. Note their emotional state at each step.

Sketch the "To-Be" Journey: Brainstorm and sketch a few key screens or interactions that could transform the user's journey from frustrating to delightful.

Share and Narrate: Share these artifacts with the team and tell the user's story to ground the abstract discussion in a human reality.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a cross-functional team is starting a new project, help me facilitate a collaborative user-journey mapping workshop, so that everyone on the team—from engineering to content—builds a shared understanding of and empathy for the user's experience.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Provide the Template: Prepare a large canvas (physical or digital) with the basic structure of a journey map (Phases, Actions, Thoughts, Feelings).

Run a "Silent Brainstorming" Session: Give everyone sticky notes and have them individually brainstorm the user's actions, thoughts, and feelings at each phase of the journey.

Facilitate the Synthesis: Guide the team in clustering the sticky notes and building a single, shared map of the user's experience.

Identify the Pain Points: Lead a dot-voting exercise to have the team collectively identify the most critical pain points in the journey, which will become the focus of the inquiry.

3. Managing Editor & Head of Content

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is defined, help me assess the feasibility of the content that will be produced and how it will fit into our existing knowledge architecture, so I can plan resources and ensure a high-quality, coherent final product.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Assess Content Feasibility: What kind of content artifacts will this inquiry likely produce (e.g., new pathways, glossary terms, a critical report)? Do we have the in-house expertise to create them?

Define Potential Artifacts: Create a preliminary list of the potential content deliverables. This helps make the abstract inquiry concrete.

Check for Schema Fit: How will these new artifacts fit into our existing JSON schemas? Will we need to extend our data model? (Interface with the Framework Engineer on this).

Estimate Resources: Create a high-level estimate of the time and expertise required to produce, edit, and fact-check the content for this inquiry.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the Content Guild is exploring a new topic, help me facilitate a "content discovery" session that moves from a vague idea to a concrete list of potential, well-defined content artifacts, so the team has a clear and actionable starting point.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Provide the "Artifact Menu": Start by showing the team a list of our existing content types (Tool, Pathway, Node, Report, etc.). Ask: "Which of these formats could best express the ideas we're discussing?"

Facilitate "Title Brainstorming": For the most promising ideas, lead a quick, time-boxed exercise to brainstorm 5-10 potential titles for the content. This forces clarity.

Use the "Proto-Schema" Prompt: Ask the Framework Engineer to sketch a rough data schema for a new content idea on the whiteboard. This makes the abstract structure tangible.

Guide the "Feasibility Check": For each proposed artifact, lead a discussion asking: "Who is the expert we need for this? How long would it take? What are the dependencies?"

4. Framework Theorist

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the team is forming its initial direction, help me ensure the Guiding Question is intellectually rigorous, well-defined, and doesn't rely on unexamined assumptions, so we can build our inquiry on a sound philosophical foundation.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Deconstruct the Question: Break down the proposed Guiding Question into its component claims, definitions, and logical structure.

Audit for Bias: Apply the "Power & Bias" contextual lens. What unstated worldviews or assumptions are embedded in the way the question is framed?

Situate in the Discourse: Connect the question to existing scholarly or ethical debates to ensure it is not naive and has the potential to make a real contribution.

Propose a Reframing: Suggest alternative wording to make the question more precise, falsifiable, or generative.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is stuck on a superficial problem, help me facilitate a "Causal Layered Analysis" workshop, so we can move beyond the surface-level "litany" to uncover the deep, systemic, and metaphorical roots of the issue.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Introduce the Layers: Draw the four layers (Litany, Social Causes, Worldview, Myth/Metaphor) on a whiteboard and explain each one.

Guide the "Litany" Dump: Start with a quick brainstorm of the surface-level problems and headlines.

Facilitate the "5 Whys": For each litany item, use the "5 Whys" technique to guide the team down to the social causes and worldview layers.

Prompt for Metaphor: At the deepest level, ask provocative questions like: "What is this whole situation a metaphor for?" or "What is the story we tell ourselves that makes this system seem normal?"

5. Research Lead

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new Guiding Question is proposed, help me quickly determine what is already known about this topic, so we can ensure our inquiry is original and builds upon, rather than duplicates, existing knowledge.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Conduct a Preliminary Scan: Perform a rapid literature review using key terms from the Guiding Question.

Identify Key Sources: Identify the 2-3 foundational texts or seminal thinkers that the team must engage with to proceed.

Assess Novelty: Based on the scan, provide an initial assessment of the question's originality. Where is the genuine "gap" in knowledge we are trying to fill?

Create an Initial Bibliography: Start a shared document with the key sources and annotations, forming the seed of the project's formal bibliography.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is starting a new inquiry, help me facilitate a collaborative "literature mapping" session, so that the entire team builds a shared understanding of the existing scholarly conversation and our potential contribution.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Provide the Seed Articles: Pre-select 3-5 key articles on the topic.

Run a "Jigsaw" Reading: Assign one article to each team member (or small group). Give them a set time to read it and become the "expert."

Facilitate the "Teach-Back": Have each expert "teach back" the core argument of their article to the rest of the group.

Co-Create the Map: As a group, create a concept map on a whiteboard that shows how the different articles relate to each other, identifying the key debates, agreements, and unanswered questions.

6. Engineering Manager, Platform

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me understand the potential technical scope and its impact on my team's capacity and health, so I can manage resources effectively and ensure a sustainable development process.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Listen for Technical Implications: As the Guiding Question is formed, listen for keywords that imply new technical capabilities (e.g., "interactive," "personalized," "data-driven").

Provide a "T-Shirt Size" Estimate: Offer a rough, high-level estimate of the engineering effort (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) to help the Head of Product prioritize.

Assess Team Impact: Does this inquiry align with the current skills and interests of the engineering team? Will it provide a good growth opportunity or will it be a source of frustrating toil?

Identify Process Risks: Does this inquiry require a new type of collaboration between Engineering and other Guilds? Flag any potential process bottlenecks early.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the product and design teams are defining a new feature, help me facilitate a "technical discovery" session with my engineers, so we can proactively identify risks and provide realistic feedback before any commitments are made.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Present the "What": Clearly present the proposed Guiding Question or feature concept to the engineering team.

Facilitate a "Risk Brainstorming" Session: Lead a structured brainstorm focused on one question: "What are all the ways this could go wrong technically?"

Use "T-Shirt Sizing": Guide the team through a quick, collaborative estimation exercise to get a shared sense of the project's scale.

Synthesize and Report: Synthesize the identified risks and the size estimate into a concise memo for the Head of Product, ensuring the engineering perspective is clearly represented in the strategic discussion.

8. Software Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me understand the concrete user-facing features that might result, so I can start thinking about the implementation details and provide realistic feedback on feasibility.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Translate Question to Features: Brainstorm a list of 2-3 potential user stories or features that would help answer the Guiding Question.

Conduct a "Napkin Sketch" Design: Create a quick, low-fidelity sketch of what the UI for one of these features might look like.

Identify Key Components: Based on the sketch, identify which existing UI components could be reused and what new components might need to be built.

Provide Feasibility Feedback: Offer a gut-check assessment to the team: "Building that seems straightforward," or "That feature sounds simple but it touches a very complex part of our codebase."

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a non-technical team member has a vague idea for a feature, help me facilitate a "concreteness" conversation, so I can understand the actual requirements and we can build a shared understanding of what needs to be built.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Ask for a Sketch: Say, "Could you draw me a quick picture of what you're imagining? It doesn't have to be pretty." This forces them to translate their abstract idea into a visual form.

Use "User Story" Framing: Guide them to articulate the request as a user story: "As a [type of user], I want to [do something], so that I can [achieve a goal]."

Talk in "Components": As they describe the feature, reframe their words using the language of our design system: "So, it sounds like we'd need a <Card> component here with a <FilterDropdown> at the top."

Build a "Paper Prototype": Collaboratively sketch the UI on paper or a whiteboard, creating a tangible artifact that you can both agree on.

9. Specialist Engineer, Planner Tools

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me assess if our external planning.html tool can support the process, or if it needs to be updated, so we can ensure our users have the right tools for their own inquiry.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Map Inquiry to Planner: Does the proposed Guiding Question suggest a workflow that our current planning.html template supports well?

Identify Gaps: Where does the planner fall short? For example, if the inquiry is highly collaborative, does the planner need better features for team input?

Propose a "Planner Variant": If there's a mismatch, propose a new, specialized version of the planner template tailored to this type of inquiry.

Estimate Update Cost: Provide a high-level estimate for the work required to update or create a new planner template.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a team is struggling to start their own project, help me facilitate a "planner onboarding" session, so they can effectively use the planning.html tool to structure their inquiry and get unstuck.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Model the Process: Share your screen and do a "think-aloud" as you fill out the first one or two sections of the planner for their project.

Facilitate a "Pair Planning" Session: Break the team into pairs and have them work together to fill out the next section of the planner.

Ask Clarifying Questions: As they work, circulate and ask questions that help them make their thinking more concrete: "What would be a measurable 'Definition of Success' for that goal?"

Use the "Prompt Synthesizer": Conclude the session by using the "Generate Prompt" button to show them how their structured input can be transformed into a powerful, shareable artifact.

10. Framework Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me anticipate the data and schema requirements, so we can ensure our content platform is prepared to support the new knowledge that will be created.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Anticipate New Content Types: Listen to the discussion. Will this inquiry produce content that doesn't fit our existing schemas for Tool, Node, or Pathway?

Draft a "Proto-Schema": Sketch out a rough JSON structure for any new content types that might be needed.

Assess Data Relationships: How will this new content need to link to existing data? Will we need to add new "foreign keys" or relationship types?

Interface with Content Guild: Share the proto-schema with the Managing Editor and Research Lead. Ask: "If we build the data structure like this, will it support the content you envision creating?"

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the Content Guild wants to create a new type of content, help me facilitate a "schema design" workshop, so we can collaboratively build a data structure that is both flexible for authors and robust for the application.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Start with the "Why": Begin by asking the content team to describe the user experience they want to create. "What does the user need to see and do?"

Whiteboard the Data: Translate their desired user experience into a set of data fields on a whiteboard. Use simple terms: "So we need a title field, a main_content field, and a list of related_links."

Define the "API Contract": Formalize the whiteboard sketch into a "proto-schema." This becomes the "API contract" between our two guilds.

Build a "Mock" File: Create a sample .json file based on the new schema and ask the content team to try and populate it. This is the quickest way to test if the schema is intuitive and meets their needs.

11. Head of Design

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me establish the "North Star" for the user experience and ensure the team is asking questions that will lead to a desirable and emotionally resonant product, so our solution is not just functional but feels good to use.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Define the "Emotional Goal": Ask the team: "Beyond the functional goal, what do we want the user to feel when they engage with the outcome of this inquiry?"

Create an "Experience Benchmark": Find 1-2 examples of existing products (even from different domains) that achieve this desired emotional goal. What can we learn from them?

Champion the User's Voice: Throughout the discussion, continually bring the focus back to the user's perspective. "How would a first-time user encounter this?"

Establish Design Principles: Propose 2-3 specific design principles that will guide the UX/UI work for this project (e.g., "Clarity over cleverness," "Guide, don't dictate").

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is stuck in a technical or content-focused discussion, help me facilitate a "user empathy" session, so we can re-center the inquiry on the human experience it is meant to serve.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Introduce a Persona: Bring a user persona to the meeting. Put their picture and a key quote on the screen. Say, "Let's pause and ask: How would [Persona Name] describe this problem?"

Facilitate a "Journey Mapping" Exercise: Guide the team through a quick, low-fidelity mapping of the user's current emotional journey related to the problem.

Use the "Empty Chair" Technique: Place an empty chair in the room and state that it represents the user. Periodically, turn to the chair and ask, "What would our user say about this decision?"

Reframe with "Feeling": Reframe a technical question in emotional terms. "Instead of asking if it's feasible, let's ask if it would make the user feel confident."

13. Design Systems Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me identify how our existing design system can support the potential features, and where we might need to extend it, so we can build the UI efficiently and consistently.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Listen for UI Patterns: As the UX/UI Designer sketches ideas, listen for recurring UI patterns (e.g., "we'll need a new type of filter," "that sounds like a timeline component").

Audit the Existing System: Check our current component library. Do we already have components that can meet these needs?

Identify Gaps in the System: Create a list of potential new components or variants that this inquiry might require.

Provide a "System Cost" Estimate: Give the team a rough estimate of the effort required to build any new, foundational components, ensuring this "system cost" is factored into the project plan.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a designer or engineer is proposing a one-off UI solution, help me facilitate a "systems thinking" conversation, so we can decide together whether to build a reusable component that will benefit the entire platform.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Ask the "Rule of Three" Question: "This is a great solution. Have we seen a similar problem anywhere else in the app? Do we anticipate needing something like this a third time?"

Facilitate a "Component Design" Sketch: Guide the team in a quick exercise to abstract the one-off solution into a more generic, reusable component. What would its "props" be? What are its variants?

Calculate the "System ROI": Lead a discussion about the trade-off: "It will take longer to build this as a system component, but it will save us time on the next three features. Is that a good investment?"

Add to the System Backlog: If the decision is to build a new component, create a formal ticket for it in the Design System backlog, ensuring it's a planned piece of work.

14. Data Visualization Specialist

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is being defined, help me identify opportunities to use data visualization to make the resulting knowledge more intuitive and impactful, so we can go beyond text to create deeper understanding.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Listen for Relational Data: Pay attention to any part of the inquiry that involves complex relationships, hierarchies, or flows.

Propose a Visualization Concept: Sketch a low-fidelity concept for a chart, map, or diagram that could represent this relational data (e.g., "What if we visualized the 'Stakeholder Map' as a network graph?").

Identify Data Requirements: What specific data points would we need to collect or structure to make this visualization possible? (Interface with the Framework Engineer on this).

Show an Exemplar: Find an example of a similar, high-quality data visualization from another field to help the team understand the potential value.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is struggling to understand a complex dataset or system, help me facilitate a "visual brainstorming" session, so we can use drawing and mapping to uncover patterns that are invisible in the raw data.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Start with a Question: Frame the session with a clear question: "What is the story we are trying to tell with this data?"

Facilitate "Sketching in Parallel": Give everyone a marker and have them individually sketch different ways to visualize the data for 5 minutes.

Hold a "Silent Gallery Walk": Post all the sketches on a wall and have the team walk around and place dot votes on the most insightful or promising ideas.

Synthesize and Refine: Lead a discussion about the top-voted sketches, combining the best elements to create a single, strong visualization concept.

15. Data Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When a new inquiry is defined, help me assess the long-term data implications, such as how we will collect, store, and process any new data generated by this work, so we can build a scalable and analyzable system.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Identify New Data Sources: Does this inquiry involve generating or collecting new types of data (e.g., user interaction data, survey results)?

Assess the Data Model Impact: How will this new data fit into our overall data architecture? Will it require new tables, new schemas, or new relationships?

Plan the Data Pipeline: Sketch a high-level plan for the data pipeline: How will we get this data from its source, clean it, and store it in a way that is useful for future analysis?

Flag Scalability Risks: If the inquiry involves collecting a large volume of data, raise any potential scalability or performance risks with the Senior Staff Engineer early.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is defining a new feature, help me facilitate a "data requirements" session, so we can proactively plan for the data we'll need for future analysis, not just for the immediate feature.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Ask the "Future Question": After the feature is defined, ask the team: "Six months after we launch this, what is the single most important question we will want to answer with the data it generates?"

Work Backwards: Based on that "future question," lead a discussion to identify the specific data points and events we need to start tracking now to be able to answer it later.

Define the "Tracking Spec": Formalize these requirements into a "Tracking Spec" document that clearly defines each event, its properties, and its trigger.

Interface with Engineering: Hand this spec to the Software Engineer, ensuring that analytics and data collection are treated as a core feature requirement, not an afterthought.

Implementation: Role-Specific Practitioner/Facilitator Cards for Tool 2
1. Chief Architect & Founder

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the team is creating the strategic plan, help me ensure the plan is not just tactically sound but also ambitious, philosophically coherent, and serves our long-term vision, so we don't get lost in incrementalism.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Review the Plan for Vision Alignment: Read the draft roadmap and OKRs. Ask: "Does this plan represent a bold step toward our ultimate vision, or is it just a safe, incremental move?"

Stress-Test the 'Why': Challenge the Head of Product on the core assumptions of the plan. Is this the highest-leverage work we could be doing right now?

Guard the Philosophy: Ensure the plan doesn't inadvertently violate our core principles (e.g., by prioritizing a feature that creates a "cage" instead of a "scaffold").

Provide the Strategic Mandate: Give your formal approval to the plan, signaling to the organization that it has your full strategic backing.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When my leadership team is getting bogged down in operational details during planning, help me facilitate a "zoom out" session, so we can reconnect with the long-term vision and ensure our plan is truly strategic.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Initiate a "Future-Back" Exercise: Pause the current discussion. Ask the team: "Let's imagine it's three years from now and we have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. What does that look like? Now, what is the single most important thing we must do this quarter to make that future possible?"

Tell a Story: Share a story about the early days of the project that reminds the team of the original passion and purpose.

Ask the "Legacy" Question: "If this is the only thing we accomplish this year, will we be proud of it?"

Protect "R&D" Time: Act as the champion for long-term, speculative work. Ensure that the plan allocates a specific percentage of resources to high-risk, high-reward inquiries that may not have an immediate payoff.

2. Head of Product & Strategy

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When we have a Guiding Question, help me translate it into a clear, prioritized, and actionable roadmap with measurable objectives (OKRs), so the entire organization is aligned and focused on the most valuable work.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Define Success (DoD): Work with the team to define the "Definition of Done" for the entire project. What does a successful outcome look like?

Run a "Pre-Mortem" Exercise: Facilitate a session where the team imagines the project has failed and works backward to identify all the potential risks.

Prioritize with a Framework: Use a prioritization framework (like RICE or Impact/Effort) to rank potential initiatives and features.

Draft and Communicate the Roadmap: Create the formal roadmap document, clearly articulating the sequence of work, the OKRs, and the rationale for the prioritization.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the Guild Leads are proposing projects, help me facilitate a strategic planning session that moves from a list of ideas to a single, coherent, and prioritized roadmap, so we can make confident, evidence-based decisions.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Provide the Strategic Context: Start the meeting by presenting the Guiding Question and the key user insights that must inform our plan.

Facilitate the "Pre-Mortem": Lead the team through a structured Pre-Mortem exercise. This is your most powerful tool for aligning the team on the true risks.

Use a Visual Prioritization Tool: Use a shared whiteboard or digital tool to map all proposed projects on an Impact/Effort matrix. This makes the trade-offs visible and the decision-making process collaborative.

Drive to a Commitment: Guide the discussion toward a clear commitment. End the meeting by stating: "Based on this, our priorities for this cycle are X, Y, and Z. We are explicitly choosing not to do A and B. Do I have everyone's commitment?"

3. Managing Editor & Head of Content

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the strategic roadmap is being formed, help me create a detailed content plan and production schedule, so I can allocate my team's resources effectively and ensure we can deliver high-quality content on time.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Deconstruct the Roadmap: Break down the high-level roadmap into a specific list of content deliverables (e.g., "Update Tool 2 Pathways," "Write new Glossary terms for v22.0").

Create the Content Backlog: Turn this list into a formal backlog of tickets or tasks.

Estimate Effort: Work with the Framework Theorist and Research Lead to estimate the effort required for each task.

Develop the Production Schedule: Create a realistic timeline for content creation, review, and publication, and communicate it to the Head of Product.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When my content team is faced with a new project, help me facilitate a "content breakdown" session, so we can move from a high-level goal to a concrete and realistic production plan.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Start with the Deliverable: Ask the team: "What is the final artifact we need to create? Let's imagine it's finished. What does it look like?"

Work Backwards: Guide the team to work backward from the final product, identifying all the necessary steps (e.g., "To publish it, we need to edit it. To edit it, we need a first draft. To write a draft, we need to do the research...").

Use a Kanban Board: Visualize the workflow on a board with columns for "To Do," "Researching," "Writing," "Editing," and "Done."

Facilitate Estimation: Lead a quick estimation exercise (e.g., with planning poker) to get a shared understanding of the effort required for each step.

(This pattern continues for all 15 roles. Here are key examples from the other guilds.)

7. Senior Staff Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the product roadmap is being planned, help me create the high-level technical strategy and identify the necessary architectural runway, so we can support the product goals without accumulating excessive technical debt.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Review the Roadmap for Architectural Impact: Analyze the proposed features. What are the major architectural challenges or dependencies?

Propose "Architectural Runway" Spikes: Identify any foundational technical work (e.g., a database migration, a new service) that must be done before a feature can be built. Propose these as high-priority "enabler" stories.

Create High-Level System Diagrams: For the most complex initiatives, create a simple block diagram illustrating the proposed technical architecture.

Vet the Plan for Scalability & Security: Act as the "red team" for the plan. Where are the potential performance bottlenecks? What are the security vulnerabilities?

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the engineering team is planning a new, complex feature, help me facilitate an "architectural design review" session, so we can collectively create a robust technical plan and build shared ownership.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Frame the Problem: Clearly articulate the user problem and the technical constraints.

Facilitate "Design in Parallel": Break the team into small groups and have each group sketch a different high-level architectural approach for 15 minutes.

Hold a "Critique" Session: Have each group present their design. Guide the rest of the team to provide constructive feedback using a protocol like "I like, I wish, What if."

Synthesize the Best Approach: Lead a discussion to synthesize the best elements from each proposal into a single, unified technical plan that the whole team agrees on.

11. Head of Design

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When the product roadmap is being planned, help me ensure that the user experience is a primary driver of the strategy, not an afterthought, so we can build a product that is not just functional but also cohesive and desirable.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Translate Roadmap to User Journeys: For each major initiative on the roadmap, map out the ideal user journey.

Identify UX Dependencies: Pinpoint where one feature's UX depends on another. Advocate for sequencing the work in a way that builds a coherent user experience over time.

Champion "Quality of Craft": Ensure that the plan includes dedicated time for non-feature work like improving the design system, fixing UI bugs, and adding polish.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Introduce the Framework: On a whiteboard, draw three columns: Claim, Evidence, and Warrant. Explain that a "Claim" is what we believe, "Evidence" is the data that supports it, and the "Warrant" is the logical bridge that connects the two.

Deconstruct the Plan: Take a key part of the proposed plan and guide the team to break it down into this structure. "What is the core claim we are making with this initiative?"

Probe the Evidence: Ask the team: "What specific, observable evidence do we have to support this claim?"

Challenge the Warrant: Ask the hardest question: "What is the underlying assumption—the warrant—that makes us believe this evidence proves this claim? What if that assumption is wrong?"

8. Software Engineer

Practitioner View

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Analyze "Session Recordings": Watch session recordings of real users. Look for "rage clicks," hesitation, or places where they go back and forth. These are signals of a broken workflow.

Identify "Desire Paths": Look for places where users are consistently trying to do something that the UI doesn't support. This is an unmet need and an opportunity for a new feature.

Map the "Friction": Create a user journey map that specifically highlights the points of friction and negative emotion in the current workflow.

Redesign the "Flow": Redesign the user flow to eliminate the friction and formalize the desire paths.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is stuck in a debate about how a feature should work, help me facilitate a "user workflow simulation," so we can make a decision based on empathy for the user's process.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Set the "Stage": Define the user persona and the specific goal they are trying to achieve.

"Role-Play" the User: Have one team member play the role of the user, and another play the role of the "computer," showing the UI mockups.

Facilitate the "Think Aloud": As the "user" goes through the flow, have them think aloud about what they are trying to do and what they expect to happen.

Synthesize the "Sticking Points": Lead a discussion to identify where the user's mental model mismatched the system's logic. This becomes the focus for the design revision.

13. Design Systems Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When I observe our teams' workflows, help me analyze how they use (or don't use) our design system, so I can improve our tools and processes to make building consistent UI easier and faster.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Analyze "Component Adoption": Use a code analysis tool to track the adoption of our design system components. Which components are most popular? Which are never used?

Interview Your "Users": Your users are the designers and engineers. Interview them about their workflow. What is the most frustrating part of using the design system?

Identify "System" Bottlenecks: Is our documentation hard to search? Is our process for requesting a new component too slow?

Improve the "Developer Experience": Based on your analysis, propose and implement improvements to the design system's documentation, tooling, and contribution process.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a team is starting a new project, help me facilitate a "design system onboarding" session, so they understand how to use our shared "Lego kit" effectively and efficiently.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Host a "System Tour": Give the team a guided tour of our Storybook, showing them the most important and commonly used components.

Facilitate a "Live Build" Session: Take one of their feature mockups and work with them to build a rough version of it in real-time, using the existing design system components.

Teach the "Contribution" Process: Walk them through the formal process for requesting a new component or a change to an existing one.

Establish a "Support" Channel: Make sure they know where to go to ask for help (e.g., the design system Slack channel).

14. Data Visualization Specialist

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When I observe how people interact with our data visualizations, help me analyze their workflow to see if they are understanding the story, so I can refine our visualizations to be more insightful.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Run a "Data Viz" Usability Test: Give a user a visualization and a specific question to answer with it. Watch to see if they can find the answer.

Use the "5-Second Test": Show a user a visualization for five seconds. Take it away and ask them: "What was the main point of that chart?"

Analyze "Interaction" Data: If the visualization is interactive, look at the analytics. What are users clicking on? What filters are they using?

Propose "Clarity" Improvements: Based on your analysis, propose specific revisions to the visualization to make its core insight more obvious.

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When the team is trying to manage a project with data, help me facilitate the creation of a "project dashboard," so we can have a shared, real-time view of our workflow and progress.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Start with the "Key Questions": Ask the team: "What are the 3-5 most important questions we need to answer every day to know if we are on track?"

Facilitate a "Metric" Brainstorm: For each question, lead a brainstorm on the specific, measurable metric that would answer it.

Sketch the "Dashboard": Collaboratively sketch a low-fidelity layout for a dashboard that visualizes these key metrics.

Work with the "Data Engineer": Partner with the Data Engineer to get the necessary data and build a simple, functional version of the dashboard.

15. Data Engineer

Practitioner View

Job to be Done: When I observe our organization's workflow, help me analyze our "data workflow"—how data is produced, moved, and consumed—so I can design and build a more efficient and reliable data platform.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Map the "Data Value Stream": Create a value stream map for our data pipelines. Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the manual steps?

Analyze "Query Logs": Look at the logs for our analytics database. What are the most common queries? Which ones are the slowest? This tells you what data is most valuable and where you need to optimize.

Interview "Data Consumers": Talk to the people who use the data. What are their biggest frustrations with the current data platform?

Propose "Infrastructure" Improvements: Based on your analysis, propose specific improvements to our data infrastructure (e.g., "We should refactor this pipeline to be event-driven," "We need to build a new data model for this use case").

Facilitator View

Job to be Done: When a team is struggling to get the data they need, help me facilitate a "data discovery" session, so they can understand what data is available and how to use it.

My Toolkit & Action Plan:

Host a "Data" Show-and-Tell: Run a session where you give the team a guided tour of your data warehouse and analytics tools.

Facilitate a "Query" Workshop: Teach the team how to write a few basic SQL queries to answer their own questions.

Use a "Data Dictionary": Walk them through the data dictionary, explaining what each field means and how it's collected.

"Pair Analyze" a Problem: Sit with the team and work with them to use the data to answer one of their specific product questions.

## Implementation Addendum: Context-Dependent Process Patterns

The following cards demonstrate the application of the "Dynamic Node Initiative" findings. They show how a single process pattern (like a Retrospective) changes its function, goals, and execution depending on the context (the Tool) in which it is deployed.

### N44: Conduct a Retrospective (Contextual Application)

#### Role: 6. Engineering Manager, Platform

**Context 1: T7 Emergency Retrospective**

*Practitioner View*

**Job to be Done:** When my team's sprint is blocked and we're about to miss our goal, help me facilitate a rapid, tactical retrospective, so we can identify the immediate impediment and get back on track *today*.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Pull the Andon Cord:** Call an immediate, time-boxed (25 min) "Emergency Retrospective."
2.  **Frame the Problem Tightly:** The only question is: "What is the single biggest thing slowing us down *right now*?"
3.  **Focus on Action, Not Blame:** Guide the team to a single, concrete action they can take in the next hour to solve the immediate problem.
4.  **Resume the Sprint:** The goal is to get back to work, not to have a long discussion.

*Facilitator View*

**Job to be Done:** When a team is spiraling, help me create a safe, hyper-focused container for them to pause, diagnose their immediate process failure, and commit to a single, tactical change, so they can regain momentum and agency.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Stop the Bleeding:** Intervene to pause the unproductive work. Frame the retrospective as a "pit stop," not a full teardown.
2.  **Use a Simple Diagnostic:** Use a simple, fast tool like "Start, Stop, Continue" but focused only on the immediate blocker.
3.  **Protect from Scope Creep:** Aggressively protect the conversation from expanding into larger, strategic issues. Defer those to the T9/T10 retrospective.
4.  **Drive to a Single, Owned Action:** The meeting is only successful if it ends with a named individual committing to a specific, immediate next step.

**Context 2: T9 Strategic Retrospective**

*Practitioner View*

**Job to be Done:** When our major project is complete, help me facilitate a deep, strategic retrospective, so we can synthesize our learnings into a durable "Playbook" that improves the entire organization.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Gather the Data:** Before the meeting, gather all relevant project data: final outcomes vs. initial goals, key decisions, and process metrics.
2.  **Analyze the Full Arc:** Guide the team to reflect on the entire project journey (T1-T8). What were the key turning points? What were our most incorrect assumptions?
3.  **Abstract the Principles:** Lead an exercise to move from specific events to generalizable principles. "What is the timeless rule we learned from this?"
4.  **Codify the Playbook:** The output is not just a list of ideas, but a formal update to our team's playbook, codifying the new, successful process.

*Facilitator View*

**Job to be Done:** When a project ends, help me guide the team through a structured reflection that transforms their specific, episodic memories into abstract, transferable wisdom, so the organization captures the full return on investment from the work.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Set a Reflective Tone:** Frame this not as a post-mortem, but as a "wisdom-harvesting" session.
2.  **Use a Narrative Structure:** Guide the team to tell the "story" of the project. This engages the DMN and helps retrieve key episodic memories.
3.  **Facilitate Abstraction:** Use prompts like "What's the general rule here?" or "If we were to write a law based on this experience, what would it be?" to push the team from recounting to synthesizing.
4.  **Insist on an Artifact:** The synthesis is not complete until it is codified. Ensure the session produces a tangible artifact (a new checklist, a playbook entry) that can be shared.

### N11: Run a Pre-Mortem Exercise (Contextual Application)

#### Role: 2. Head of Product & Strategy

**Context 1: T2 Planning Pre-Mortem**

*Practitioner View*

**Job to be Done:** When we have a draft plan, help me run a generative pre-mortem, so we can uncover a wide range of potential risks and build a more resilient strategy.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Frame the Scenario:** "Imagine it's six months from now, and this project has failed completely. What happened?"
2.  **Generate Risks Divergently:** Use silent brainstorming to generate a high quantity of potential failure modes. Defer judgment.
3.  **Cluster and Prioritize:** Group the risks into themes and identify the top 3-5 most probable or catastrophic risks.
4.  **Integrate into the Plan:** For each top risk, build a specific mitigation or contingency plan directly into the project roadmap.

**Context 2: T4 Decision Pre-Mortem**

*Practitioner View*

**Job to be Done:** When my team is deadlocked between two viable options, help me use a comparative pre-mortem, so we can make a clear, risk-aware decision and break the analysis paralysis.

**My Toolkit & Action Plan:**
1.  **Acknowledge the Deadlock:** State clearly: "We are stuck between Option A and Option B. Let's analyze how they might fail."
2.  **Run a Time-Boxed Pre-Mortem on A:** Run a fast (15 min) pre-mortem focused only on Option A.
3.  **Run a Time-Boxed Pre-Mortem on B:** Run a separate, fast (15 min) pre-mortem focused only on Option B.
4.  **Compare the Failure Modes:** The decision is not about which option has more risks, but which has risks that are less catastrophic or more easily mitigated. Use this comparative analysis to make the final, documented decision.
