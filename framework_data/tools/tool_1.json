(Gadamer, H-G. *Truth and Method*. Continuum, 1975.)\n*   **Arts \u0026 Design:** Dominant **Interoceptive** and **Sensory** scores reveal that artistic inquiry often begins with a \u0027felt sense\u0027 or somatic signal, prioritizing internal resonance over immediate logical categorization. (Dewey, J. *Art as Experience*. Minton, Balch \u0026 Co., 1934.)\n*   **Business \u0026 Agile:** Elevated **Social** and **Auditory** scores indicate that business inquiry is driven by \u0027listening to the market\u0027—detecting signals through customer interviews and social observation. (Blank, S. *The Four Steps to the Epiphany*. K\u0026S Ranch, 2005.)\n*   **Culture \u0026 Ethics:** The peak **Metacognitive** and **Emotional** scores suggest that ethical inquiry begins with deep self-reflection and an assessment of one\u0027s own positionality and values. (Schön, D. *The Reflective Practitioner*. Basic Books, 1983.)\n*   **Pedagogy \u0026 Facilitation:** High **Social** and **Metacognitive** scores reflect the facilitator\u0027s need to \u0027read the room,\u0027 simultaneously sensing the group\u0027s dynamic and monitoring their own influence on it.
